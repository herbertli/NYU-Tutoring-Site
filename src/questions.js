    q: "What if there's a group in the lab that isn't there for tutoring?",
    a: "Sometimes, there are other groups/people working there. Just give them a heads up that they may have to give up their seats in order to make space for those people coming in for tutoring."
  }, {
    q: "What if there are non-Intro to Programming students showing up for drop-in tutoring?",
    a: "Technically, we are not supposed to help these students as they are supposed to have other resources available to them. The rule of thumb is to always prioritize students taking Intro to Programming. If you have nothing else to do and are capable of helping them with their assignments, you may help non-0002 students. It is especially important to log these interactions in the tutoring log."
  }, {
    q: "What if no one is showing up to my sessions?",
    a: "Especially in the beginning of the semester, this is very common.  You will rarely have an entire session with no students in attendance. If there is truly nothing for you to do, bring some homework, or a good book! Remember that regardless of attendance, you are expected to be present for all hours listed."
  }, {
    q: "What if my shift is over and people are still there/coming?",
    a: "DO NOT feel obligated to stay. You are each scheduled to work a certain number of hours a week and are not expected to work for anything more than that. More often than not, there will be another tutor coming later on, and if not the same day, then the next. If you are constantly overwhelmed, please contact your tutoring coordinator"
  }, {
    q: "What if I'm getting overwhelmed with too many students at my sessions?",
    a: "Returning tutors will know that difficult assignments, unclear lectures, exam weeks, and assignment due dates will cause spikes in attendance. If you're experiencing high volumes, please let me know. I'll be able to track this with the tutoring log in case we need to reschedule someone else for double coverage during that time. Try your best to help everyone there, ask students in the same class to work together if possible, and encourage those who need further help to come at another time!"
  }, {
    q: "What if I am unable to solve a problem or unable to assist a student and need further referral?",
    a: "If you're having trouble effectively helping a student or you're unsure of how to best answer their question, you have a couple of options... The best option is to use our Slack channel! You can post your questions in the #problemhelp or #questions channel and your fellow tutors or I will be there to help. Use your surroundings! You can ask fellow your tutors, or maybe even other students with the same professor may have some insight. Last but not least, don't be afraid to tell them that you don't know! This is a great chance for them to email and introduce themselves to their professor. You can also tell them to come to another tutoring section later on!"
